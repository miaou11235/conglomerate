        <p><b>Biography</b></br>Marissa has led an interesting life before and after she came out as trans. She used to be a pro wrestler. Then, she began studying film at the University of Pennsylvania. When she was at school, she saw a preacher shouting at students. The preacher was shouting at students as young as sixteen, condemning what they were wearing. Marissa was infuriated, and she wanted to defend them. She yelled back at the preacher, eventually telling him that she was trans. After that, she quickly transitioned because she knew she needed to stand up for trans people. After President Trump was elected, she wrote <i>The PC Lie: How American Voters Decided I Don't Matter</i>, which explains reasons why many people voted for Trump and what the consequences are for the trans community. Now, she has graduated from college, and she is an activist. She is a successful author and podcaster.</p>
