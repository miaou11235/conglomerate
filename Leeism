		<p>We do not start life with a road map laid out before us; we must create our own path through the wilderness. Our human existance is too diverse for a straight and narrow way. We face danger, struggle, fear, and sorrow that the major world religions religions do not account for.</p>
		<p>We come looking to religions to find answers about our daily experience: the pain we live with, the discrimination we face, the homelessness we suffer, the trauma we endure. We do not receive answers. At best, we receive reassurances of prayers. We are told what rituals we should do to improve ourselves. At worst, we are rejected and ostracized. At worst, we are killed.</p>
		<p>The Leeist faith does not deny suffering. It does not pretend that suffering is for a greater good. The realization that there is no answer to the "problem of evil," as philosophers put it, is a core tenant of Leeism.</p>
		<p>Instead of silencing those who suffer, Leeists lift them up. Instead of ostracizing those who do not fit the mold, Leeists celebrate them.</p>

		<h2>Leeist Beliefs</h2>
		<p><i>Humanity</i></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Humans are basically good, except for those who are not.</li>
			<li>Humans are not special snowflakes, but they all have inherent worth.</li>
		<p><i>Evil</i></p>
			<li>Everything is random, and there is no morally satisfying reason for the evil in the world.</li>
			<li>Suffering is part of life and it is meaningless.</li>
			<li>There is no such thing as a sin that directly influences natural events.</li>
