<p>Saying something I've never said before is hard. not something like "lobsters are the crayons of the stars." telling someone something about myself that I haven't told anyone before.</p>
<p>(change of subject) I shouldn't have a hard life. Life should be easy for me because I'm white, middle class, supposedly smart, etc. I should be on my way to some prestigious private school in another state.</p>
<p>But I'm not. That's ok. But, you know, loss of privilege stings. Part of me feels like I'm entitled to have graduated and to be going to university because my friends are. But that's not how it works, not just for me but for everyone. I'm glad to be part of everyone. (I'm not too glad to be flunking out of anatomy and physiology because it's triggering.)</p>
<p>I had a (short) dream the other night. Flying spaghetti monster, it was terrifying. It's probably a thing that I want to tell but also really don't want to, but it's just a dream.</br>
<p>The ex boyfriend texted me and wanted to get back together. I said no, and he said, "we were so good together!" I said no again. And then he commented that the moisture level of my genitalia during his assault proved my love for him. And then I woke up and started panicking.</p>
