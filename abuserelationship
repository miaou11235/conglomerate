<h1>Did you know?</h1>
<p>Abusive relationships are very common. People who have been in abusive relationships previously are more likely to be in more abusive relationships. Abusive relationships can involve emotional manipulation, physical violence, and/or sexual assault. It is commonly thought that one is weak for staying in an abusive relationship, but that is not true because individuals in abusive relationships face a lot of pressure from their partners that others cannot understand from the outside.</p>
