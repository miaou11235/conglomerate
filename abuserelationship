<h1>Did you know?</h1>
<p>You've probably heard of <b>abusive relationships.</b> You might be in an abusive relationship in your future. You might have been in an abusive relationship previously. You might be an abusive relationship <i>right now.</i> I couldn't tell you because I'm a webpage.</p>
<p>It might seem like an abusive relationsip is an abstract concept that won't really affect you, but that's not necessarily the case. It can happen to anyone, even if they appear to be completely suave and in control.</p>

  <h2>I'm in an Abusive Relationship. What Should I Do?</h2>
  <div style="text-align: left; padding: 5px 350px 5px 350px;">
    <ul>
    <li> Call 911 or the emergency number in your area if it is an emergency.</li>
    <li> Find local resources. They probably exist no matter where you are. If you need to escape the house, you can find a shelter for that purpose. You can use a search engine or call 211. 211 is a very useful resource.</li>
    <li> Find online resources. Online support groups, forums, and chat rooms can help you feel less alone.</li>
    <li> Tell a family member or friend that you trust.</li>
    <li> If you are afraid of retaliation from your partner when you break up with them, get a local organization involved and they can help you.</li>
    <li> Know that this is not how your life is going to be forever and you're going to get out of this.</li>
    <li> Get professional counseling. A local or online charity may provide it for free or for a low cost. You're not crazy, but you've been through something horrible and it's hard to process it.</li>
    <li> Remember that it's not your fault.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>How can I help others?</h2>
  <div style="text-align: left; padding: 5px 350px 5px 350px;">
    <ul>
    <li> If you see signs of abuse in someone's relationship, you can talk to the person and ask them if they're okay. You can be a listening ear for them in a time when they might be afraid to talk to anyone.</li>
    <li> You can find out about local organizations and see if you can volunteer.</li>
    <li> You can volunteer for a telephone hotline and talk to people in distress.</li>
    <li> Interject if you think that something someone does could be considered abusive.</li>
    <li> Oppose messages that condone abusive relationships, even in jest.</li>
    <li> Be willing to talk to anyone and to help them.</li>
  </ul>
