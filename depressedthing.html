<h1 style="color: red;">I feel so out of sorts</h1>
<p>I feel <b>pressured</b> by my therapist to tell her more</p>
<p>I feel negatively (can't name an emotion) that I said details</p>
<ul>
<li>Anxious</li>
<li>Like something <i>bad</i> will happen</li>
<li>Uneasy</li>
<li>Nauseated </li>
</ul>
<h5>I don't know what to do</h5>
<p style="font-size: 40px;">I don't want to tell anyone but I want to tell someone. everything makes me feel nauseated</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">I'm scared of how much I don't know how to cope. I keep skipping meals and consciously eating less at meals</p>
<p>I almost want to escape by going to the hospital or something but I don't know what good that would do. what can they tell me that I don't already know? I can't take a vacation from my mind. it would just be a different place and even if it was nicer I'd still have to come back</p>
