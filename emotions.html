	<h2>The lowdown on emotions</h2>
	<div id="emolist">
		<ul style="text-align: left;">
			<li>Emotions are neither good nor bad, right nor wrong. Feelings just ARE. They exist. It is not helpful to judge your emotions.</li></br>
			<li>There is a difference between having an emotion and doing something or acting on the emotion.</li></br>
			<li>Emotions don't last forever. No matter what you're feeling, eventually, it will lift and another emotion will take its place.</li></br>
			<li>When a strong emotion comes, you do not have to act on your feeling. All you need to do is recognize the emotion and feel it.</li></br>
			<li>Emotions are not facts. When emotions are very powerful they feel just like the truth.</li></br>
			<li>You cannot get rid of emotions because they serve important survival functions.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<h2>Emotions help us, even if it doesn't seem like it</h2>
	<div id="helplist">
		<ul style="text-align: left;">
			<li>Emotions help us communicate. They show in our body language and in our facial expression, letting others know when something is wrong.</li></br>
			<li>Emotions help us overcome obstacles. They give us motivation to change things, whether in our external situation or in our mind.</li></br>
			<li>Emotions give us information about our situation, like alarms when we feel like something isn't right.</li></br>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<h2>Myths about emotions</h2>
	<div id="mythlist">
		<ul style="text-align: left;">
			<li>There is a <i>right</i> way to feel in every situation: there is no right or wrong way to feel.</li></br>
			<li>Letting others know that you are feeling bad is a weakness: talking to others about how you feel is a good thing to do.</li></br>
			<li>Uncomfortable feelings are bad and destructive: everyone has uncomfortable feelings sometimes, but these are neither good nor bad and they will not hurt you unless you act on them.</li></br>
			<li>Being emotional means being out of control: feeling an emotion is not the same as acting on that emotion.</li></br>
			<li>All painful emotions are a result of a bad attitude: no emotion is right or wrong and you can't control all of your emotions with your attitude.</li></br>
			<li>If others don't approve of how you are feeling, you shouldn't feel the way that you do: other people can't change your emotions, and your emotions are neither good nor bad.</li></br>
			<li>Other people are the best judge of how I am feeling: no one is feeling what you are feeling besides you.</li></br>
			<li>Painful emotions are not really important and should be ignored: emotions can be painful, but they do not last forever. You can't get rid of painful emotions besides by waiting for them to pass.</li>
