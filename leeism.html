		<p>We do not start life with a road map laid out before us; we must create our own path through the wilderness. Our human existance is too diverse for a straight and narrow way. We face danger, struggle, fear, and sorrow that the major world religions religions do not account for.</p>
		<p>We come looking to religions to find answers about our daily experience of suffering. We do not receive answers. At best, we receive reassurances of prayers. We are told what rituals we should do to improve ourselves. At worst, we are rejected and ostracized. At worst, we are killed.</p>
		<p>The Leeist faith does not deny how horrible the world is. It does not pretend that everything a greater good.</p>
		<p>Instead of silencing those who suffer, Leeists lift them up. Instead of ostracizing those who do not fit the mold, Leeists celebrate them.</p>
