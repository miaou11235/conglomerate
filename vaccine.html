        <h1>Vaccines</br><small>They Don't Cause Autism</small></h1>

        <h5>Many of us do not trust vaccines because we do not want our children to get autism. When we decide not to vaccinate our child, we make a very serious decision. We make a grim statement about our priorities and our values.</h5>
	<p>It's natural for us to want to protect our children from something as scary-sounding as autism. Haven't we all seen the commercials on TV for organizations like <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AutismSpeaksFlyer_color_2017.pdf" />Autism Speaks</a> that show screaming children and overwhelmed parents? Who wouldn't want to stop that from happening to their families? It sounds like an easy decision if that's all there is to consider. Don't get the vaccine equals don't get autism, right?</p>
	<p>No, that's not true. There is no evidence that vaccines have any causal link with autism. <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/" />Autism</a>, or Autism Spectrum Disorder, is something that we are born with, not something we can acquire. It's a different way for our brains to work, not a worse one. It's easy to make it look like autistic children are always having tantrums, like some organizations try to portray them, if you only film them when they are having tantrums. Some of us believe that vaccines cause autism because of a lack of science literacy.</p>
	<p>That's not all there is to it. Vaccines are given for a reason. They prevent us from getting horrible, deadly diseases like measles, mumps, and rubella. Vaccines not only protect our children from getting the diseases, but they prevent our children from passing the diseases on to others. Something called "herd immunity" is extremely important to our society's health. Herd immunity means that, because almost everybody is vaccinated, the few people who are not vaccinated will be okay because there's no one to pass the disease to them. Because there have been relatively few people who refused to have their children vaccinated, herd immunity is still mostly intact. However, more and more people are now refusing, so herd immunity is starting to	 decline.</p>

	<p>That leads to the ethical statement that we make when we refuse to vaccinate our children. Even if we don't think about it, <b><i>we're clearly stating through our actions that a dead child is better than an autistic child</i></b>. Remember, vaccines do not actually cause autism. Vaccines and autism are not related. So all we are doing when we refuse to vaccinate our children is making the world worse. Why are we making the world worse? Because <b><i>we would rather cater to our dangerous ideology than to the needs of our children</i></b>. We might not know the weight of our decision when we make it, but that does not excuse us from the harm we do to our progyny, to our communities, and to our species at large.</p>
