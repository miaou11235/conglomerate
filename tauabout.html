	<h1>&pi;</br><small style="font-family: arial; font-size: 30px;">a mathematical conspiracy</br>to make YOU fail trig</small></h1>
	<p style="font-size: 22px;">Everyone learns about &pi; (pi) in school. It pervades the school system, from elementary to postgraduate. Everyone knows that trigonometry is difficult. Many of us fail. It drops our GPAs and often prevents us from getting into the schools we want. What few of us know is that &pi; is the reason why trig is so hard. &pi; is NOT the important circle constant that they told us it was. <b>But there's a better way</b>.</p>
	<p style="font-size: 24;">&tau; (tau) is the symbol that big math has been hiding from us. <mark>&tau;=2&pi;</mark>, or <mark>6.28...</mark>.</p>
	<div id=thing class=thingy><p style="font-size: 22;">&pi; is <b>wrong</b> because it makes math <b>more complicated</b>. Even though &tau; is just 2&pi;, it makes trig more simple, elegant, and <b>easy to understand<b>.</p></div>

	<figcaption>This formula is made simpler when &pi; is replaced with &tau;.</figcaption>

	<figcaption>Using &tau; to work with the sine function is easier, with rounder numbers and more elegant results.</figcaption>
